Code Refactoring

This project is part of an "On-the-Job ticket" meaning we will be modifying an existing code. Our goal is to refactor an existing code (or to improve the code without changing its functionality). For example, the original code in the HTML that I was given did not have enough semantics, therefore I have added semantics to further improve viewing of the code and its description element. As for the CSS, I have organized elements to be nested, as some of them contained the same properties thoughout each element.

In my repository contains a 'Web Pic' folder which is a Demo Pic of the devloped webpage. An 'Assets' folder which contains both my 'style.css' and images. Lastly, I have my 'README.md', 'index.html', and 'LICENSE' file.

Down below is quick link to view my HTML code.
